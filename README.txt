# Files

"Glacier_aquisition.R" - R script used to extract smaller batches of data from the eBird basic dataset. Output files are used in the field notes analysis, and imported into GIS software for spatial filtering. Following spatial filtering, files are re-imported into this script combined into smaller files.

"Glacier_analysis.R" - R script used for analysis of spatially filtered eBird data.

"Glacier_fieldnotes.R" - R script that selects eBird fields notes with relevant habitat and behavior keywords. These resulting keywords are processed manually.
